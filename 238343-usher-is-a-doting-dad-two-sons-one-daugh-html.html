The singer’s first child, Usher Raymond V, 12, was born on November 26, 2007.</p><p class=dh>He had his firstborn child with his now ex-wife Tameka Foster, whom he divorced in 2009. The “You Make Me Wanna…” singer also shares another son with Foster, Naviyd Ely Raymond, 11, who was born on December 10, 2008.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c910d2f3c8dd0737a372bbae78a51c7c.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Usher and his son Usher Raymond V at Usher's New Look Foundation - World Leadership Conference & Awards on July 21, 2011, in Atlanta, Georgia | Photo: Chris McKay/Getty Images</p><p class=dh>In a previous interview for the cover of Essence magazine in August 2008, Usher <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/news/usher-and-baby/#323685>had this to say</a> about his first son: “He’s gonna admire me.” He also vowed that the boy would look up to him.</p><p class=dh>A month after his Essence statement, the singer noted how he didn’t have a father growing up. He shared how not having a father as a child wasn’t a good enough reason for him to be a bad one to his own children.</p><p class=dh>Usher and his own father, Usher Raymond III, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/new-dad-usher-gives-advice-on-fatherhood/>had a troubled relationship</a>. He abandoned him and his mother, Jonetta Patton when the future musician was only a year old.</p><p class=dh>The “Confessions” singer said he has since forgiven his father for all the things he did to hurt him.
