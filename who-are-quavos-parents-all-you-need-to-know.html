All you need to know</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Quavo and his nephew Takeoff were at a private party in Houston when the latter was fatally shot. According to&nbsp;TMZ, an argument started between Quavo and others after the rapper lost a dice game. The debate, which became about who was the better basketball player, continued outside.&nbsp;</p><p>The outlet claims that as Quavo walked away, someone threw a punch, sparking a melee in which at least 10 shots were fired. Takeoff sustained fatal gunshot wounds to the torso and head, the Harris County Medical Examiner’s Office said.&nbsp;</p><h3>Migos were raised by Quavo’s mother, Edna Marshall</h3><p>Quavo (real name Quavious Keyate Marshall) was born on 2nd April 1991 in Athens, Georgia, to Edna Marshall. His father, like Offset’s and TakeOff’s, left when he was young.&nbsp;</p><p>Offset and Takeoff moved into Edna’s house after the family relocated from Athens to Gwinnett County.&nbsp;“We always stayed in the same house. We share everything,”&nbsp;Quavo told&nbsp;Fader. “He’s [Takeoff] basically like my brother.”</p><p>“I don’t look at him [Quavo] as an uncle,”&nbsp;Takeoff said,&nbsp;“but more as my brother.”&nbsp;Quavo told&nbsp;Rolling Stone&nbsp;that Edna didn’t complain about raising three teenage boys:&nbsp;</p><p>“She knew how to raise you as a man. She had a house full of niggas playing games, shoes off, eating all the food, and it’s hard times – but she never complained.”</p><p>Quavo and Takeoff repaid Edna by buying her a house in 2017.&nbsp;“ME and Take Jus Bought Mama A House!!! Tha Big Way!!!,”&nbsp;Quavo tweeted. When the trio moved out, they made the studio their home. Music executive Pierre Thomas told&nbsp;The New York Times:&nbsp;</p><p>“What made me really want to go hard for them is that they packed all their clothes and moved into the studio – literally lived there, sleeping on reclining chairs and making music all day.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqivsRmqK6ZpqTAbrzAq5ynrKNirq24jLKmrmWemrKledOoZKSmn6x8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
