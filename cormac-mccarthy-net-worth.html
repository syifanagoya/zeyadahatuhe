Cormac died on June 13, 2023 at the age of 89.</p><p>Known for his unique narrative style that often eschews punctuation and quotation marks, McCarthy's novels explore themes of life, death, and the existential struggles of mankind, set against the backdrop of the American South and Southwest. From his first novel "The Orchard Keeper" to his Pulitzer Prize-winning work "The Road", McCarthy's writing left an indelible mark on American literature.</p><p>Several of his books were adapted into films, notably "No Country for Old Men," "The Road," "Child of God" and "All the Pretty Horses.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Cormac McCarthy was born Charles McCarthy Jr. on July 20, 1933, in Providence, Rhode Island. The family moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, where McCarthy attended Catholic High School before enrolling at the University of Tennessee. During his time at university, he won the Ingram-Merrill Award for creative writing in 1959 and 1960. Although he left the university before completing his degree, these formative years in Tennessee would later inspire much of his early work.</p><h2 id=initial-publications-recognition><strong>Initial Publications and Recognition</strong></h2><p>McCarthy's first novel, "The Orchard Keeper", was published in 1965. This marked the start of the "Southern Gothic Trilogy," which also includes "Outer Dark" (1968) and "Child of God" (1973). These early works established McCarthy's style, with their focus on morose themes and evocative depictions of Southern landscapes. His fourth novel, "Suttree", released in 1979, is often considered his masterpiece from this period. It took him over 20 years to write, a testament to McCarthy's meticulous approach to his craft.</p><h2 id=mid-career-shift-border-trilogy><strong>Mid-career Shift and The Border Trilogy</strong></h2><p>In the 1980s, McCarthy moved to Texas and started writing about the American Southwest. His fifth novel, "Blood Meridian" (1985), marked a shift in location and tone, introducing readers to a darker, more violent exploration of human nature. This novel, though not an immediate commercial success, has since been recognized as one of the greatest novels of the 20th century.</p><p>This thematic shift led to the "Border Trilogy" of novels â€“ "All the Pretty Horses" (1992), "The Crossing" (1994), and "Cities of the Plain" (1998). "All the Pretty Horses" won both the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award, bringing McCarthy into mainstream literary acclaim.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-247458 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/GettyImages-108720070.jpg alt="Cormac Mccarthy" width=594 height=394 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-247458 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=late-career-widespread-recognition><strong>Late Career and Widespread Recognition</strong></h2><p>McCarthy's later works include "No Country for Old Men" (2005) and "The Road" (2006), both of which were adapted into critically acclaimed films. "The Road", a haunting tale of a father and son journeying through a post-apocalyptic world, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2007.</p><p>In addition to his novels, McCarthy also wrote an original screenplay, "The Counselor" (2013), which was directed by <a href=# title="Ridley Scott Net Worth">Ridley Scott</a> and starred <a href=# title="Michael Fassbender Net Worth">Michael Fassbender</a> and PenÃ©lope Cruz.

He was married three times and has two children. His first marriage, to Lee Holleman, resulted in his son, Cullen. His second marriage, to Annie DeLisle, lasted from 1967 until their divorce in 1981.
