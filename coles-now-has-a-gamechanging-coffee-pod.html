With coffee pods becoming so much more popular, we wanted to develop an option for eco-conscious customers to dispose of their pods at home, instead of in their landfill bin.”</p><p>The new Coles Urban Coffee Culture Organic home compostable pods are made with bio-sourced cellulose and vegetable oils — and break down in about the same amount of time as an orange peel.</p><p>“We are always looking for ways to reduce problematic and unnecessary single-use plastic from Coles Own Brand products, and offering a home compostable coffee pods option is one way of doing it,” Ms White continued.</p><p>She described it as a “game-changer” for at-home coffee experiences and for those worried about whether taste would be compromised, Ms White said it still had the “same great taste ... but now with the added bonus of being compostable at home”.</p><p>“We know that very few councils accept compostable packaging in their council food and</p><p>organics waste bin, which is why we have worked with our suppliers to find a coffee pod solution which customers can compost at home,” she said.</p><p>“Composting at home is also a great way for our customers to reduce the amount of food waste going into landfill,” she added.</p><p>Meanwhile, Melbourne-based coffee company <a class=body-link href=#>Grinders also recently introduced compostable coffee capsules</a> to its popular range.</p><p>Each of the coffee capsules is made from bio-based, compostable resin and is compatible with all ‘original’ Nespresso coffee capsule machines.</p><p>The new Coles pods will mark the first time a major Aussie retailer will produce a pod which customers can simply throw in their home compost bin.</p><p>“We are sure customers will love the new home compostable coffee pods,” Leanne said.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Coles has a goal to have all its Own Brand product packaging 100 per cent recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025.</p><p>The pods, which can be used in machines designed for Nespresso-style coffee pods, have been</p><p>certified by the Australasian Bioplastics Association and will be available in Coles supermarkets from April 4, for $4.50 for a pack of 10.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme8Wopp1nlKe2r7eOnKalnaNiu7DDjKGYrGWRYrSiucScn5qml567qHnCqJ2fnZVivbCwjqecsKtdqMGwvthobWmaZG1%2Fcq%2BQmp1yb5GahqJ9xJ6anJliZ4J1gsOfbWk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
