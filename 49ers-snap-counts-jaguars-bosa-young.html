The <a href=#>Jaguars</a> had just 17 carries — and a season-low 59 rushing yards — Sunday.</p><p>They played 57 snaps of offense versus 62 for the 49ers. Most 49ers starters were on the sideline by game’s end and tackle <a class=ath_autolink data-id=QvjDp8H5rFl2HQZi href=#>Trent Williams</a>, whose right ankle isn’t 100 percent, didn’t play the final two series.</p><p>Here’s how the individual snaps were divided:</p><p><strong>Quarterback:</strong> <a class=ath_autolink data-id=0ItM9ROZC8mOtKOv href=#>Brock Purdy</a> 49, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=3Nxpcb3Oda9xKjNY href=#>Sam Darnold</a> 13</p><p>Purdy was sacked twice, the second of which appeared to be a horse-collar tackle by linebacker <a class=ath_autolink data-id=5VLZ8h3Dzgjo7fNn href=#>Foyesade Oluokun</a> that wasn’t called by the officials. It’s not a penalty if a quarterback is pulled down by the back of the jersey while in the pocket, but Purdy scrambled left on the play and was well outside of the spot where left tackle Williams initially lined up.</p><p>Purdy was excellent, 15-of-17, on dropbacks on which he was kept clean. He also was impressive in muddy pockets. He was 5-of-8 for 103 yards and a touchdown on blitz plays. Per Pro Football Focus, Purdy’s 91.7 overall grade was a career high.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not a horsecollar? Defenders are permitted to take down QBs from the back of the shoulder pads if the QB is still in the pocket (Why this is allowed? I have no idea). However, on this play, which resulted in a sack, Brock Purdy appears to have vacated the pocket. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/V7zqdJk5bI</a></p><p>— Matt Barrows (@mattbarrows) <a href=#>November 13, 2023</a></p><p><strong>Running back:</strong> <a class=ath_autolink data-id=FSp2bTsEwxXRf1oa href=#>Christian McCaffrey</a> 47, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Ek8HP6BrOl1VpbTR href=#>Kyle Juszczyk</a> (fullback) 38, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=U2DluzFgHJ8ncRvW href=#>Elijah Mitchell</a> 17, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=P7pb1hturRnejFF7 href=#>Jordan Mason</a> 3, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=0aLiSjl18CoPgsUd href=#>Deebo Samuel</a> 2</p><p>McCaffrey may have been kept out of the end zone for the first time in nearly a year (Nov. 27 versus the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=50 href=#>New Orleans Saints</a>), but he had his most prolific outing, 142 total yards, since the 49ers’ Week 4 win over the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=31 href=#>Arizona Cardinals</a>.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The left-side stretch runs also were back with Williams’ return to left tackle. McCaffrey had carries of 12 and 15 yards to that side as well as a screen pass that gained 17 yards. He remains the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2 href=#>NFL</a>’s rushing leader with 747 yards, which is 122 yards ahead of the next most prolific rusher, the Tennessee Titans’ <a class=ath_autolink data-id=oJQx7e7sJBwSTdBo href=#>Derrick Henry</a>.</p><p><strong>Receiver:</strong> <a class=ath_autolink data-id=53v7fOffjiSNI8Y9 href=#>Brandon Aiyuk</a> 42, Samuel 33, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=lHyALtoXdwgWGsr0 href=#>Jauan Jennings</a> 18, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=aCJV2zXHtp7c2EMG href=#>Willie Snead IV</a> 14, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=P9vUblVTDysASuCY href=#>Ronnie Bell</a> 12</p><p>Samuel went in motion across the backfield on the first three offensive snaps, which forced the Jaguars to move in that direction and gave Purdy clean pockets throughout the opening drive. Samuel rushed for 79 yards and a touchdown when the 49ers visited Jacksonville two years ago. The Jaguars seemed to remember that, though Samuel still managed 29 yards on three runs, including a 23-yard score in the third quarter.</p><p>Snead was elevated from the practice squad Saturday, perhaps because <a class=ath_autolink data-id=kngqu3tROk5PI4zY href=#>Ray-Ray McCloud III</a> was sick during the run-up to the game. Both Snead and Bell can return punts with Bell getting tapped for that duty in the fourth quarter. McCloud played six snaps on special teams, none on offense.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>With Deebo Samuel back, 49ers' offense is back to looking inevitable</p></a><p><strong>Tight end:</strong> <a class=ath_autolink data-id=dDoajDmT8A77o3JR href=#>George Kittle</a> 45, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=PBpHMlSE9St7CaGc href=#>Charlie Woerner</a> 24, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=MjYu8iyeI4lEE8il href=#>Ross Dwelley</a> 15</p><p>The 49ers’ best go-ball threat? It might be Kittle, who has caught deep passes in two straight games — 34 yards against the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=37 href=#>Cincinnati Bengals</a> and 66 yards against the Jaguars. Kittle beat linebackers on both plays and there was no safety lurking over the top in Jacksonville, which allowed Kittle to literally walk into the end zone.</p><p>The 66-yard score was Kittle’s longest since he had an 85-yarder against the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=40 href=#>Denver Broncos</a> in Week 14 of the 2018 season.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kyle Shanahan knew this was a TD before anyone else. He started walking in the opposite direction while George Kittle was on the 25-yard line. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0g8cC6HHz9</a></p><p>— Matt Barrows (@mattbarrows) <a href=#>November 13, 2023</a></p><p><strong>Offensive line:</strong> <a class=ath_autolink data-id=FCFwEslG2XAbXUZZ href=#>Jon Feliciano</a> 62, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=gtELE8JVdAkMqWM7 href=#>Jake Brendel</a> 62, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=BsrkAbCM7DdYyHCN href=#>Spencer Burford</a> 62, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=DUwvYCvbqMBPWjma href=#>Colton McKivitz</a> 62, Williams 46, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=d40hgh4POhpheiLW href=#>Jaylon Moore</a> 16</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Right guard Burford had perhaps his best game of the season in giving up no quarterback pressures. He also was integral on an underrated play of the game, McCaffrey’s third-and-2 carry at the end of the second quarter on which he was initially stuffed at the line of scrimmage but managed to keep his balance and pick up a first down. Burford also kept his feet amid all the bodies in the pile and did his version of the Bush Push — the “CMC Shove?” — to help the tailback across the first-down marker. The 49ers eventually scored a field goal on the drive.</p><p>Burford’s performance is interesting because the 49ers had seemed prepared to give Feliciano playing time — presumably at right guard — once <a class=ath_autolink data-id=qL9dW5r1No9JfnIC href=#>Aaron Banks</a> (toe) is back at left guard. Feliciano also was strong Sunday in netting an 81.7 grade from PFF.</p><p>The offensive lineman who struggled the most? It may have been Williams, who was good on the hoof but whose sore right ankle may have given him trouble anchoring against the pass rush. He gave up four pressures and after the game said his ankle was around 70 to 75 percent healthy. He did not do any further damage to the ankle Sunday, he said.</p><p>On Monday, Shanahan said that someone rolled onto McKivitz’s ankle during the game and that he was dealing with ankle and knee soreness as a result. He’ll be day to day this week with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=yxZFkNc72rK4NTjq href=#>Matt Pryor</a> or Moore on call if he can’t play against the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=60 href=#>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>.</p><p><strong>Defensive line:</strong> <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ahF0mNm2RkiMq4Se href=#>Nick Bosa</a> 37, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=bYN0BjyCMwquw2Z0 href=#>Javon Hargrave</a> 37, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=kvFEEwQxlY2nweYH href=#>Chase Young</a> 35, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=QgurcJ268IZqdfMC href=#>Arik Armstead</a> 34, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=8ZBG1Pw5nJKt8PIt href=#>Javon Kinlaw</a> 24, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=kLTcIRtIIQSqGkIu href=#>Kevin Givens</a> 22, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=LL1x08yI7AkajrgM href=#>Clelin Ferrell</a> 22, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Nx7hLSGAVXG3vubB href=#>Randy Gregory</a> 21</p><p>Young took his first snap as a 49er on second down on the second series when he lined up as a stand-up linebacker in the center of the defensive line with Bosa right beside him. They did the same on the 49ers’ fourth defensive series.</p><p>On most plays, Young was the right defensive end — his preferred spot in Washington — with Bosa on the left. But they switched spots on three straight snaps in the third quarter on which Bosa was on the right and Young on the left. Both finished with four quarterback pressures, per PFF:</p><ul><li>Bosa 4</li><li>Hargrave 4</li><li>Young 4</li><li>Armstead 1</li><li>Ferrell 1</li></ul><p>Bosa, who played 100 percent of the defensive snaps against the Bengals — the first time in his career he’s done so — played 65 percent of the snaps Sunday. That’s his lowest share since Week 1, and Shanahan on Monday credited Young in part for keeping Bosa fresh.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“That’s been our goal here for a number of weeks and we’ve struggled to do that,” Shanahan said. “I think getting Chase in here made it a lot easier. I think the way the game went made it a lot easier. It’s hard to take Nick off the field because of how good he is, obviously, but it’s something we’re always trying to do.”</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Steve Wilks is the big winner as 49ers’ pass rush, coverage finally converge</p></a><p><strong>Linebacker:</strong> <a class=ath_autolink data-id=4NSrY6Hr9tL552a4 href=#>Fred Warner</a> 54, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=eUZupNQm3lQHR1C2 href=#>Dre Greenlaw</a> 52, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=R69FDA0urH6lOnR8 href=#>Oren Burks</a> 12, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=C7YMi5OAnT7CUsW6 href=#>Curtis Robinson</a> 3, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=k0AGU01wORnqrLSd href=#>Dee Winters</a> 1</p><p>The linebacking corps regained its energy and quickness coming out of the bye, but the missed tackles that plagued the unit didn’t fully go away.

He had four total in five previous seasons. He’s tied with Las Vegas’ <a class=ath_autolink data-id=D5UVhehcetD20VpX href=#>Robert Spillane</a> and Cincinnati’s <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Xej5yWNbUYzNQtcM href=#>Logan Wilson</a> for most interceptions by a linebacker this season.</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/11/13190709/USATSI_21885017-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1707 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Fred Warner recorded his third interception of the season Sunday against the Jaguars.

That may have been true, but Lenoir still had trouble. He gave up seven catches on seven targets for 107 yards, and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=0gjixjs0a34LXvKj href=#>Trevor Lawrence</a> had a passer rating of 118.8 on those targets.</p><p>Thomas was flagged for pass interference in the second half. But he only allowed only two catches for 14 yards. Ward gave up no catches and had a nice pass breakup in the end zone. However, he was flagged twice for illegal contact (one was declined) and leads the 49ers with 10 penalties this season:</p><ul><li>Illegal contact 4</li><li>Pass interference 3</li><li>Holding 3</li></ul><p><strong>Safety:</strong> <a class=ath_autolink data-id=T09psu7P3UOyN7Pf href=#>Tashaun Gipson Sr.</a> 54, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=5srFSr7G9sLB8jKF href=#>Talanoa Hufanga</a> 53, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=QSMp7UUdb6ziuFZh href=#>Ji’Ayir Brown</a> 4, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Ptse4a1IA1GrXSfu href=#>George Odum</a> 3</p><p>Hufanga reprised his role as quasi linebacker, finishing with seven tackles, four of them around the line of scrimmage. The Jaguars had two plays of 20 yards or more Sunday, a sign of a powerful San Francisco pass rush combined with strong safety play. The 49ers, by contrast, had nine such plays.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Special teams:</strong> Woerner 22, Odum 17, Dwelley 16, Brown 16, Mason 16, Robinson 16, Jean-Charles 16, Burks 15, Winters 13, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=5McX4ppvEU7zTv7P href=#>Jake Moody</a> 12, Thomas 11, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=82UyoaMIe9O34oyi href=#>Taybor Pepper</a> 9, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Gi075x001015zGjs href=#>Mitch Wishnowsky</a> 9, Oliver 8, Burford 6, McKivitz 6, Moore 6, Feliciano 6, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=BK0CEY3Bnb2G4TcS href=#>Nick Zakelj</a> 6, Pryor 6, McCloud 6, Hufanga 3, Bell 3, Samuel 2, Warner 1, Lenoir 1, Kinlaw 1, Givens 1, Gregory 1, Ferrell 1, Young 1</p><p>Two of Wishnowsky’s three punts were downed inside the 20-yard line, including one at the 1-yard line.
