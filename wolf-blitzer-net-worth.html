He was named Wolf after his maternal grandfather. Wolf's parents, Cesia and David Blitzer, were Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Poland who survived the Holocaust and Auschwitz concentration camp. His maternal grandparents did not survive the war. The family immigrated to the United States after World War II, when Blitzer was just one year old, under the 1948 Displaced Persons Act. From then on, Wolf was raised in Buffalo New York and graduated from Kenmore West Senior High School. Blitzer earned a Bachelor of Arts in history from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1970. While attending college for his Masters in International Relations at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, he studied abroad and learned Hebrew at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-170265 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Wolf-Blitzer.jpg alt="Wolf Blitzer" width=387 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-170265 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><h2 id=early-career><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><p>Blitzer started his journalism career with the Reuters news agency in Tel Aviv in the early '70s.

Later that year, Sadat made a historic visit to Israel and Blitzer covered the negotiations between the two countries that led to the signing of the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. In 1985, Blitzer published his first book, "Between Washington and Jerusalem: A Reporter's Notebook."

Wolf was the first journalist to interview him and later wrote a book about the trial called "Territory of Lies." Blitzer's interview with Pollard was controversial due to the legal action against him. Blitzer's book was included on the New York Times list of Notable Books of the Year for 1989.</p><h2 id=cnn><strong>CNN</strong></h2><p>Blitzer joined CNN as the cable network's military affairs reporter in May 1990.
