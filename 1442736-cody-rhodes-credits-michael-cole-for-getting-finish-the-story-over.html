Recently the <a href=#>former Executive Vice President of AEW</a> gave credit to Michael Cole for getting the phrase ‘finish the story’ over.</p><p>With <a href=#>WWE 2K24</a> coming out in about a month, there was a special hands-on event for the game. The 2K24 cover star was also present at the event where he was interviewed by <a href=#>Uproxx</a>. During the interview, The American Nightmare talked about finishing his story. He also mentioned that <a href=#>Michael Cole</a> was the reason for the phrase to get over with the fans.</p><p>“I feel like I’ve got to give credit to Michael Cole because I came up with it and I said finish the story on my weight belt last year for the Royal Rumble. But Michael Cole’s saying it (around the 1:12 mark of the 2023 Royal Rumble match) is what really kind of emphasized it on what that is,” Cody Rhodes said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Rhodes also mentioned that everyone having their own story is what’s unique about WWE 2K24.</p><p>“Everyone having their own story is the part that’s kind of come out lately. That’s so unique. <a href=#>CM Punk</a>’s story, Drew (McIntyre)’s story, watching the commercial for the game itself and seeing Hulk Hogan talking about his story, The Undertaker, Steve Austin talking about their story. You never know if your stuff’s going to click. Maybe it will click for others. And I feel like I got something right. It’s for the industry as a whole. And I love that and I just hope that it actually can not just be a never-ending story. We can finish the story, start a new story.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNtaXBrZmKwsLDYZqmhp5SawG6v0Z6boqyjYrqqr8eanKVlk6S5pnnFqKlmn5Wpwaq6xmadoqaZqLVuwMeeZKysn6fGbrvVnqk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
