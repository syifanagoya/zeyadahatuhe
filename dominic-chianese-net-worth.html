According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Chianese’s net worth is as high as $15 million, an amount earned through his successful career as an actor, which started in the early 1950s.</p><h3>Dominic Chianese Net Worth $15 Million</h3><p>Dominic is of part-Italian ancestry; his grandfather emigrated to the USA from Naples in 1904. Dominic went to The Bronx High School of Science, and after matriculation, he worked with his father on construction sites, since his father was bricklayer/mason, but soon also enrolled at Brooklyn College, and attended classes at night. He graduated in 1961 with a BA in Speech and Theater Studies.</p><p>His career started in off-Broadway theaters, performing musical comedy, but then got his first acting lessons from Walt Witcover and soon he made his Broadway debut, in the play “Oliver!” in 1965, and from then has featured in numerous Broadway and off-Broadway productions, which have added considerably to his wealth. However, he struggled in his early career, and so took up the guitar. and performed in taverns and restaurants. Furthermore, before launching his screen career, Dominic worked as a recreational worker for the Drug Commission of New York State in a rehabilitation center.</p><p>In 1972 he was cast in the film “Fuzz”, but then in 1974 was selected for the role of Johnny Ola in the crime-drama film “The Godfather: Part II”, starring <a href=#>Al Pacino</a>, <a href=#>Robert De Niro</a> and <a href=#>Robert Duvall</a>. The role kick-started his career and new roles were easily coming his way. In 1976 he featured in “All the President’s Men” (1976), while in 1979 he appeared in the crime-drama thriller “…and justice for all.”, which only increased further his wealth.</p><p>Dominic started the ‘80s with the role of Alexei Vartova in the TV series “Ryan’s Hope” (1980-1981), but didn’t have much success during the decade, as he made only a couple more brief appearances in TV series, and in the film “Second Sight” (1989), which went unnoticed. He had several roles until the late ‘90s, and the role of Junior Soprano, but all were minor, and didn’t have much influence on his net worth. Then in 1999 his life changed for good, when he was selected for the role of Junior, and featured in 86 episodes of the Award- winning crime-drama series “The Sopranos”, that featured <a href=#>James Gandolfini</a>, <a href=#>Lorraine Bracco</a>, and <a href=#>Edie Falco</a> in the lead roles. The success of the show added a significant amount to Dominic’s net worth. While the series lasted, Dominic remained active in searching for other acting engagements, and as a result, featured in such films as “Unfaithful” (2002), “When Will I Be Loved” (2004), and “Adrift in Manhattan” (2007). In 2011 he was the Reader in the fantasy comedy “Mr. Popper’s Penguins” (2011), and was then selected for the role of Leander Cephas Whitlock in the TV series “Boardwalk Empire” (2011-2013). To speak further of his accomplishments as an actor, he played Judge Michael Marx in “The Good Wife” from 2012 to 2015, and will appear in films “Active Adults” (2017) as Bart, and “Umberto D” (2018), as the lead character.</p><p>Dominic has also used his musical talents to increase his wealth. Back in 2000 he released his first album “Hits”, on which he sang American and Italian popular songs, while in 2003 he released his second album, entitled “Ungrateful Heart”, which comprises 16 Neapolitan songs.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Dominic has been married to Jane Pittson since 2003. Previously he was married to Merle Molofsky, with whom he has three children.</p><p>Dominic is also a well-known philanthropist, and has received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor for his philanthropic endeavors.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=21.714855433699><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Dominic Chianese</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$15 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 24, 1931</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Bronx, New York City, New York, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 11" (1.8 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Soundtrack</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Brooklyn College, The Bronx High School of Science</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Jane Pittson</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Children</td><td>Dominic Chianese Jr., Leah Espy Chianese, Rebbeca Scarpatti Chianese, Alexander John Gwozdz Chianese, Dominica Roskelly, Daughter Sarah Chianese</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Gaetano Chianese, Angelina Chianese</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0156940/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series</td></tr><tr readability=20><td>Movies</td><td>The Godfather Part II, The Family, Unfaithful, Dog Day Afternoon, Adrift in Manhattan, Mr. Popper's Penguins, Crimes of Fashion, ...And Justice for All, All the President's Men, The Last New Yorker, When Will I Be Loved, If Lucy Fell, Out for Justice, The Public Eye, Night Falls on Manhattan, Went t...</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>The Sopranos</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=5.3842105263158><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=7><td>1</td><td>[on his role as Corrado "Uncle Junior" Soprano] About a week after my audition, one of the executive producers came in, kept me in a room for an hour and a half with different kinds of glasses.
