During the appointment it’s alleged she was given a prescription “to access a drug to be used to end the child’s life”. Authorities also believe the doctor was aware of the intended use of the drugs.</p><p>News.com.au understands the prescribed drug was insulin, however authorities are still waiting on confirmation from toxicology reports from the hospital.</p><p>Two days later, the girl was taken to a local medical facility by a concerned family member where she was transferred to Albany Hospital and then the Perth Children’s Hospital by the Royal Flying Doctor Service.</p><p>Police arrested the 40-year-old woman on January 28 and charged her with attempting unlawfully to kill. She has been refused bail.</p><p>The 47-year-old male GP was also refused bail and charged with the same offence. They are both due to appear at the Stirling Gardens Magistrates Court on February 16.</p><p>According to a GoFundMe campaign created by Ms Gough in 2016, the daughter suffered from a “neurological issue”, which “affects her ability to organise her gross and fine movement patterns”.</p><p>The fundraiser was started to raise $20,000 to pay for costly Masgutova Neurosensorimotor Reflex Integration treatment which can help restore underlying neurosensorimotor dysfunction.</p><p>“She has been unable to learn to move her body voluntarily or effectively, which means she finds it difficult to eat, chew and swallow,” Ms Gough wrote at the time.</p><p>“Holding toys in her hands is mostly impossible without help. When she tries to roll over, push up or become mobile, she has little success and quickly becomes extremely exhausted.”</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Perth data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Perth</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme9GemKVlnJ6zpnvNnq6sZZyes6Z71ppkpq2dYrSxecKhmKuflZl6uLXToWSarKSaurHAxJ1kpq2imbKzec6fZG%2Bxn2S7psPSZqqtp6KufHV%2Fk3JtbJqSm4Z0sI%2BbaJpukmd%2Bo4OUcG9pbWeafniw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
