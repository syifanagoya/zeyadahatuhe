So I was in that, and we were watching the Academy Awards … and suddenly my ribs started to panic. Everything in here started to freak out,” she continued.</p><p><span>“[My friend] was like, ‘If you stand up, they’ll think you’re <b><a href=#>Kanye West</a></b>, they’ll think you’re protesting. You can’t stand up!'”</span></p><p>So Garner managed to stay put until the commercial break, when she suddenly realized she had to go to the bathroom.</p><span class=caption></span><p><span>“We go into the bathroom because she’s going to have to hold something up. It’s not pretty, but I just feel like you should know the truth about these things,” Garner told Fallon, who was starting to look a bit embarassed.</span></p><p><span>“The connection of the bodysuit, because it had a hook-and-eye situation, was in an intimate position. It was, like, in, my vagine,” she said, while Fallon squirmed!</span></p><p>“I couldn’t reach it, so I said to my friend, ‘I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I think you’ve got to get this,'” she went on.</p><p>“She’s a good friend,” Garner added. “She said, ‘If this has to be done, it has to be done, but listen, I want you to give it a good college try!'”</p><p>Watch the whole hilarious conversation in the video above!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGepp6es6a%2BjKCYq6aVp3qurcqeqmaekaG5sLqMm6Ouq5hixKrAx2amrJuRp8Buwc2doJ6rXajBsL7YZq5qbmdphnJ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
