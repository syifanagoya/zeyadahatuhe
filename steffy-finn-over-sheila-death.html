Allegedly. We’ve all still got our doubts, of course, but as Jacqueline MacInnes Wood put it on a recent episode of The Talk, “Ding dong, the witch is dead!”</p><p>You’d think no one would be complaining, but Deacon doesn’t even entirely believe it was self-defense and Finn… Well, he’s a bit busy moping to be there for his wife. Yes, we get it, his mom&nbsp;is&nbsp;dead, but first he ran off to tattle to Deacon, and then, after a pep talk from Hope, he came home only to run out&nbsp;again&nbsp;as Steffy was begging him to be there for her.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Finn-Steffy-blood-BB-HW.jpg alt="Finn Steffy B&B" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>She was terrorized, she took a life and she doesn’t even have her husband to lean on! When Wood spoke about what happened on The Talk, though, she didn’t have quite the same response as her character. The show flashed a photo of Steffy holding a bloody knife next to Sheila, and Wood happily launched right into the Psycho stabbing sound.</p><p>“Oh, I was in complete shock,” she admitted when asked her reaction to learning Sheila’s time was up. “First and foremost, I love Kimberlin Brown. She is fantastic. You never know what you’re going to get with her <span>—</span> she is 110 percent.”</p><p>As for the deadly war between in-laws, “They’ve been going toe to toe for so long, it’s cool to know that Steffy went up against one of the best villains in daytime.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/JPI_Episode9218_0002070471-e1709651148976.jpg alt="B&B, a shocked Steffy stands in her kitchen with a bloody knife, staring at Sheila bundled in her hood across from her" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>But, realistically, Steffy’s shaken. Killing someone is horrifying, no matter who’s on the receiving end or for what reason. Plus, she was stalked and terrified and is very definitely still a bit in shock.</p><p>“Steffy needs Finn to man up,” Wood put bluntly. “She needs her man there, she needs him to stand up for… What is going on? It’s absolutely crazy because Sheila has terrorized her family for so long.” Then, without missing a beat, Wood cracked, “And Steffy honestly doesn’t want to have to murder Finn too.”</p><p>Check out the entire video below, in which they also talk about everything from motherhood to Wood’s Emmy win!</p><p></p><p>But will Finn actually be able to “man up” and be there for his wife? Or has this shaken him too much? It&nbsp;just&nbsp;happened, so it does make sense that he’d need some time. Still, it would be lovely if both husband and wife could get through this together, rather than apart!</p><p>What do you think? Is this the end of “Sinn?” Will Finn be able to get past this and forgive Steffy before it’s too late and she’s gotten fed up with him? Not that we think she’ll actually resort to murder… Still, um, tread carefully, Finn.</p><p><strong>Steffy and Sheila are just the start — check out our photo gallery of <a href=# rel=noopener>Bold & Beautiful‘s biggest rivalries</a> over the years!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmraCVYq%2BwuMNmmKecXam1pnnBnpiurJmbwq17zZ6urGdnZ31zf5Boqq2dlpvGbrLIp6Vmp6aav26%2Fx56gpZldmbKiwMdo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
