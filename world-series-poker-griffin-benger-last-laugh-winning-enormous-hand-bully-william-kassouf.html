Tons of money, lots of luck, a bit of skill, and super slow motion fights with no blood. What's not to love?</p><p>During the recent <a href=#>World Series of Poker</a>, in a hand nearing the final table, William Kassouf engaged Griffin Benger in a war of words.</p><p>Kassouf is notorious for his "speech play," where he talks openly to other players attempting to gain inside information. In this confrontation, he said to Benger:</p><p>"What do you want me to do, do you want me to go all-in or fold? Talk to me. You don't say anything, I'm going to have to ship you. Play for the win, right? You doing the same?"</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-207288 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/poker.jpg alt="(Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)" width=900 height=571 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-207288 class=wp-caption-text>(Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</p><p>Having already heard Kassouf talk for some time in this manner, this was just the straw that broke the camel's back. Benger responded:</p><p>"You're just an abusive person, man, it's not funny. It's not a game. You're being abusive. What you're doing to me, you're a bully. It's rude. It's mean."</p><p>In a fit of emotion, with Kassouf holding pocket kings and Benger pocket aces, both players went all in. The five cards laid out on the table afterward didn't help either player, and Benger took the hand which included <strong>27 million chips</strong>, eliminating Kassouf from the tournament.</p><p>Kassouf took home <strong>$300k</strong> for placing 17th, and Benger is still in the competition, having earned at least <strong>$1 million</strong>.</p><p>This may be one of the sweetest single-hand victories the WSOP has ever seen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJorqiqnJl6tLHRopysZaCkuKa%2BjKCpop6WnrtursSnnp6qXaGutMCMpZiun5hixKq6zaKloGWVo7yzuc6uqmagkaOxbq7UpaOyZaeeua21wKZkpJmjqLy2so4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
