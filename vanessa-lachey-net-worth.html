She currently stars in the CBS crime drama, NCIS: Hawaiʻi, and co-hosts the popular Netflix dating show, Love Is Blind, with her husband Nick Lachey. Keep reading to learn about <a href=#>Vanessa Lachey’s net worth in 2023</a> and how much she makes per episode of NCIS: Hawai’i.</p><p><a href=#>NCIS: Hawaiʻi</a>&nbsp;is the fourth spin-off in the&nbsp;NCIS&nbsp;franchise and focuses on Jane Tennant, played by Vanessa, and her talented team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service in Hawaiʻi. They are responsible for investigating incidents relating to military and national security.&nbsp;NCIS: Hawaiʻi&nbsp;premiered in September 2021 and is currently in its second season. In February 2023, CBS announced that&nbsp;NCIS: Hawaiʻi&nbsp;was renewed for a third season for 2023-2024, according to our sister publication,&nbsp;<a href=#>Deadline</a>. Lachey is the first female and Asian American to lead an NCIS&nbsp;franchise.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Parade</a> in January 2023, she spoke about what she loves most about playing Jane on NCIS: Hawaiʻi. “It’s a really awesome role that I get to play,” Lachey told the site. “I’m so honored that I get to be her because she does it all. She’s a mother, she’s a friend, and she’s a SAC of not only Hawai’i, but obviously as you see in the L.A. episode, also of the Pacific Rim. And because of that I, am now in charge of the case. I love that that’s truly how it is in the real world, and that we’re portraying that on television as well.”</p><p>Lachey also talked about what it’s like being the only female in charge in the NCIS universe. “It’s meaningful on so many levels. Not just for me as a woman, as a mother, but also me as a minority. To be able to know that none of those descriptive titles hold me back, but in fact propel me not only in this role but in my position in the franchise, has made me super grateful,” she explained in the interview.</p><p>Read on to see Vanessa Lachey’s net worth in 2023 and how much she gets paid per episode of NCIS: Hawaiʻi.</p><h2><strong>What is Vanessa Lachey’s net worth in 2023?</strong></h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vanessa-and-Nick-Lachey-1.jpg alt="Vanessa and Nick Lachey" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>What is Vanessa Lachey’s net worth in 2023?

Vanessa and her husband have served as the hosts of Love Is Blind for four seasons. “If you think of working with your spouse, you’re probably like, ‘Oh my god. Absolutely not.’ Right? But it has been the best marriage therapy for us,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Scary Mommy</a> in January 2023.</p><p>Vanessa first met her husband Nick Lachey, the lead singer of the pop band 98 Degrees, on TRL (he was married to his ex-wife Jessica Simpson at the time).

The intimate wedding ceremony was held at Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands.</p><p>The couple has invested in multiple properties together and has purchased and sold several homes.
