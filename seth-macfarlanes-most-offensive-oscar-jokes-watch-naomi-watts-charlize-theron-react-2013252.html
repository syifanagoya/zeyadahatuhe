Jury's out. The Family Guy and Ted creator, 39, struck the wrong note with many viewers — and celebrity audience members inside the Dolby Theatre — with jokes that bordered on sexist, racist and homophobic.</p><p>During his "We Saw Your Boobs" song, for example, MacFarlane trilled with the Los Angeles Gay Men's Chorus, MacFarlane called out winners <a href=#><strong>Meryl Streep</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Charlize Theron </strong></a>and <a href=#><strong>Angelina Jolie</strong> </a>plus nominees <a href=#><strong>Naomi Watts</strong></a>, among others. As the cameras panned to the audience, both Theron, 37, and Watts, 44, looked visibly annoyed by the the number — but those reactions, alas, were&nbsp; a pre-taped bit planned for the routine.)</p><p>When the song was done, MacFarlane took pains to distance himself with the gay singers behind him. "Just so you know, I'm not actually a member of that chorus, I was just joining in at the end there."</p><p>Other controversial quips? See the roundup below and tell <strong>Us</strong>: What did you think of MacFarlane's performance?</p><p><strong>1.</strong> "Our next two presenters, at least one is honest about being a former exotic dancer," introducing <a href=#><strong>Channing Tatum</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a></p><p><strong>2.</strong> "We have finally reached the point in the ceremony where either <a href=#><strong>Javier Bardem</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Penelope Cruz </strong></a>or <a href=#><strong>Salma Hayek</strong></a> comes onstage and we have no idea what they're saying — but we don't care, because they're so attractive," introducing Hayek</p><p><strong>3. </strong>"This is a story of a man fighting to get back his woman who's been subjected to unthinkable violence — or, as <a href=#><strong>Rihanna</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Chris Brown</strong></a> call it, a date moive!</p><p><strong>4.</strong> "To give you an idea of how young she is, it'll be 16 years before she's too young for Clooney," on Beasts of the Southern Wild's <strong>Quvenzhane Wallis</strong>, 9.</p><p><strong>5. </strong>"And those of you who gave yourselves the flu two weeks ago to 'get there'?
