That was when I first became aware of Jaime King (after she hosted <a href=#>a 1998 episode</a>). She was known as “James” King and was part of the heroin-chic era of models. Jaime was indeed <a href=#>addicted to the drug</a> and got clean after her boyfriend, photog David Sorrenti, died of an overdose.</p><p>Jaime has since moved from the runway into acting. She’s not a huge name but works steadily. Jaime currently stars in Hart of Dixie (CB digs that show) and will soon appear in Sin City: A Dame to Kill For (I’m looking forward to that movie even if no one else cares). She seems to enjoy her new-ish wholesome life as a parent to a 10-month-old boy, James, with husband Kyle Newman.</p><p>Jaime uses her Instagram account to rile up the masses. She upset hipsters by <a href=#>declaring normcore “lame.”</a> She made a splash by posting <a href=#>a breastfeeding photo to Instagram</a>. Now she’s revealed her struggles with PCOS and endometriosis. Jaime’s condition was undiagnosed for many years, and she endured five miscarriages (and an ectopic pregnancy) before her successful experience with baby James. She wants her fellow sufferers to know they’re not alone:</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jaimeking4.jpg alt="Jamie King" width=550 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>“For all the struggling women & moms out there that think they are alone – This is the truth about conceiving my son and struggles after. 8 yrs of pain and undiagnosed PCOS & Endometriosis. 9 doctors until Dr. Randy Harris diagnosed me & saved my life from a severe ectopic, 5 miscarriages, 5 rounds of IVF, 26 IUI’s, most with no outcome, 4 1/2 years of trying to conceive, 26 hours of brutal labor, early delivery b/c of sudden preeclampsia, tearing and tearing after the stitches were in once I was home, milk supply issues, painful mastitis, uncontrollable crying while breast feeding, worked until the day before I [gave] birth and went back after 6 weeks after because I was afraid of letting others down.”</p><p>#youarenotalone #ihavetobebravetosupportothers #realtalkthatterrifiesus</p><p>[From <a href=#>Jaime King on Instagram</a>]</p><p>After I started writing this post, Jaime deleted this statement and photo from Instagram. I have no idea why she yanked it. I did see some cruel internet comments poking fun at her for claiming to be “brave.” I do think the subject should be discussed, and it sucks that Jaime was pressured to delete her post. Many women suffer from PCOS and endometriosis. Both afflictions are terribly painful and often misdiagnosed. Awareness of the subject can only be a good thing.</p><p>Jaime seems like a cool chick. Did you know that she’s friends with Lana Del Rey? I included a photo of them on a coffee date together.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jaimeking5.jpg alt="Jamie King" width=550 sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wenn21226873.jpg alt="Jamie King" width=550 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Jaime King, Fame/Flynet & WENN</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbG9oaYVxe8maoKadj6C2r7O%2Bq5yvnZGhwKC0xKuWqKqUmq6tq9aiq6GXoJi8tKvEp5uopZWpv6q70qKqmG2Pora0r8CrqaKZl5rAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
