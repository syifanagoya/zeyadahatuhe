Their wedding was filmed for "Selling Sunset's" season three finale, "A Not So White Wedding." In March 2021, a pregnant Quinn graced the cover of "Playboy South Africa," and the couple welcomed son Christian Georges Dumontet on May 15, 2021. Christine said of Christian's birth, "He was coming out sideways, and his umbilical cord was wrapped around him. They said his heart rate's going down. All I hear is, 'Emergency C-section. Let's go, let's go!'" She added, "And then when we were doing the emergency C-section, my heart rate was going down, the baby's heart rate was going down. And then one of the nurses went up to Christian and said, 'You need to make a priority right now. You have to choose one.' He was like, 'Both. You needâ€¦ Both.'" Quinn has said that she had a hard time filming season four of "Selling Sunset" because she was suffering from postpartum depression.</p><p>In March 2022, two men attempted to break into Christine and Christian's mansion while the family was home. Quinn said of the scary experience, "This was the most horrifying moment of my life when we're laying in bed and there is two armed men that we're watching on camera literally four feet from me, and my baby's sleepingâ€¦ very close to us, to the right of us. I want people to know to take this very seriously. This stuff does happen in L.A., it's happening all the time. I don't know what would've happened if they would've been able to get through that glass. Because they would've reached our bedroom, and they would've probably shot us."</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>Quinn and Richard live in a 5,917 square foot mansion in the Hollywood Hills; Christian paid $5 million for the home in early 2019. The three-story estate includes five bedrooms, seven bathrooms, and floor-to-ceiling windows that allow the family to watch "deer, hummingbirds, a lot of wildlife." Christine said of her dream home, "I actually used to have the listing on our house and I used to do open houses and would sit in the open house every Sunday and I would picture myself living in the house, getting coffee with my husband and now I live in that house that I envisioned myself living in. I snatched that up."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97wa6qoqaVqMBusdeemq6smauytHvCoamiq6Seu6Z50K6gp6Zdo7K1edaoqa2gXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
