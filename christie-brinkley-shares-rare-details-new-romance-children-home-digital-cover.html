She is launching a new range of still wines under her <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Bellissima </a>brand, which features the hugely popular zero sugar, vegan, and certified organic prosecco. Launched four years ago, <strong>the brand blossomed when the wife of an Italian vineyard owner decided Christie would be the perfect partner</strong> after watching her on Instagram.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=e6k1w_ERVsGl data-wc=61>&nbsp;"When I first got on social media, I was shy about it and I didn't know what to talk about, so I talked about my garden and raising beautiful vegetables and flowers with no chemicals," Christie shared, adding: "So they came to me and said, 'We want to pour the wine for you if you would want to partner with us.'"</p><p id=eSIp_10FOt6r data-wc=17>It was a match made in heaven, as Christie says the "foundation" of her life is health.</p><p id=e_cOeCK1OKeY data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Christie Brinkley parties with Rebel Wilson and Cindy Crawford for special Super Bowl party</a></strong></p><p id=eVWJxwzxyBQ9 data-wc=1><strong>WOW:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Christie Brinkley takes fans by complete surprise with latest celebratory picture</a></strong></p><p id=eHOaemqxW9pD data-wc=51>"I like to exercise so I am always able to move and go with the flow, and I like to eat foods that are healthy so I am fueling my body and I must say, usually I am the one still going when people younger than me are fading!" she jokes.</p><p id=e2O4Y4xCDyBO data-wc=55>But that prosecco comes out whenever it can - "I like to say it's like an exclamation point on your day" - and for this special <a class=hm-link href=#>digital cover with</a> <strong>HELLO!

I lived like a gypsy my whole life and this wasn't supposed to be my house for this long - it was a holding station – but then it turned into this amazing place to raise a family.</p><p id=ekQl-waeqLu2 data-wc=62>"It has hills and a pond, and when we get snow in the winter kids come from near and far and bring sleds, and everyone including my kids would play. In the summertime we have barns and chickens and puppies and room for everyone to spread out and come home.<strong> It's a real family compound, and it's such a nice family house.</strong></p><p id=eDn7s4D2hbHj data-wc=58>"It was originally built by the Gardiner family, who had an island off the coast, their own private sovereign domain before the revolution, and a famous pirate once buried treasure there. The tower has so much history; they found the oldest flag in America that predates Betsy Ross, it's the Hulbert flag and it's now in a museum.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=eDwGM-HnPZ7C data-wc=6><strong>WATCH:&nbsp;At home with Christie Brinkley</strong></p><p id=e9YSuX8CgDHL data-wc=73>"It's really the kind of house people love to play hide and seek in, with so many nooks and crannies. It has really become part of my family, and my son said the sweetest thing one day when he turned and said, 'Someday when I have kids I will build myself a little house in the woods right there, and the kids can walk over to see you any time, day or night.'</p><p id=eGYpvHbu4qLI data-wc=8>"It's something every mother would love to hear."</p><p id=eDmHox6EM8wJ data-wc=1><strong>MORE:<a class=hm-link href=#> Inside Christie Brinkley's jaw-dropping beach house you can rent out&nbsp;</a></strong></p><h3>You're a big advocate for wildlife and the environment - how is that reflected in this space?</h3><p id=e9qH3tbnLXxa data-wc=27>"There is no space because it's filled to the brim.<strong> I like to think it's eclectic bohemian chic but also take that with a grain of salt!</strong></p><p id=eDCOtUEdjGIA data-wc=36>"But every scratch and dent has a story behind it so I love it, it's the kind of house the kids skateboard through and never have to worry when the board goes flying through the air.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/95f3e61c437a-cb-final-6-z.jpg><p id=eR1EyKpLzuT2 data-wc=50>"I also like to bring the outdoors in, very much so. I grew up in California where there is a lot of bougainvillea, and I have spent <a class=hm-link href=#>so much of my life in the Caribbean</a>, so I love plants indoors; in the family room there is now a gigantic tree that is too big to get out!</p><p id=eNfbbQ2oXsM3 data-wc=69>"The kitchen has palm trees on the kitchen counter, geraniums and ferns, and then shells that I have collected over the years from around the world that I have been so lucky to have visited. I will make things with these items - lots of family pictures are framed in frames I have made out of shells, and on the back I write the beach the shells came from.</p><p id=ezrY9CBtLAOC data-wc=9>"It's a house of souvenirs and memories and stories."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8237f9f7d035-cb-final-2-z.jpg><h3>Is&nbsp;this a place where you like to get the whole family together? What are your favorite ways to entertain here?</h3><p id=eBc2JjYND3FY data-wc=41>There is nothing better than being together in the kitchen cooking up a big meal together. We have a fireplace in the kitchen and we alway have it going, and we cook up a storm and we gather round the table.</p><p id=ezfGTbkw19YU data-wc=26>"And I love the firepit outside to gather around, I just love having a glass of wine or prosecco together and catching up with each other."</p><h3>Can you tell us what started you on the journey to making wine and your brand Bellissima?</h3><p id=e80abXlEoGHf data-wc=75>"We started with three wines and proseccos after my business partners, Richard DeCicco and his wife Ro, found this beautiful vineyard in Italy that had never had any chemicals used on it, just pure as could be. The vineyard owners really wanted a partner that could speak to the fact that they were organic and the wife of the vineyard owner said, 'Christie Brinkley is always talking about her garden,' so they came to me.</p><p id=eI0J_aGp-AaL data-wc=43>"Organic really is so much better for your body and your planet, and<strong> people have learned over the last few years it's better for your health to reduce sugar intake</strong>, so we've made our entire range of new, still wines also sugar free."</p><h3>When it comes to your wellness regime, can you tell us what a typical day in the life of Christie Brinkley would be?</h3><p id=eZZrb6iZ340D data-wc=34>"There is no typical day, because of the nature of my job I need to be ready to go in any direction and that means the foundation of my life is about being healthy.</p><p id=e15eInMuStjG data-wc=48>"I like to exercise so <a class=hm-link href=#>I am always able to move and go with the flow</a>, and I like to eat foods that are healthy so I am fueling my body, and I must say usually I am the one still going when people younger than me are fading so I do have a good amount of energy.</p><p id=es4-r9qbFSzE data-wc=55>"I try to fit prosecco in whenever I can - when people drop by the first thing I do is pop a cork, it makes a normal day into a special day. Whenever I hear that sound you have to do a 'woohoo!' I like to say it's like an exclamation point on your day."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3524aa75b335-cb-final-4-z.jpg><h3>COVID put a stop to so many family celebrations, including your daughter Alexa's wedding, how is the planning going?</h3><p id=eag8oyEVabss data-wc=37>"Alexa [and fiance Ryan Gleason] love being engaged and are very much enjoying this time in their lives. But whenever she starts to plan there is another uptick in Covid, and safety for everyone is their priority."</p><h3>Have you given her any tips for the wedding day?</h3><p id=e2-mFU5SEqrG data-wc=16>"Having been through four divorces I am not the one to ask for any wedding advice!</p><p id=e55Jy_9P9-_1 data-wc=16>"Even wedding planning I never did a ton of wedding plans, they all just came together."</p><h3>With your singing talents and those of ex-husband Billy Joel, would you unite to do a special performance at Alexa’s wedding?</h3><p id=epHMH52IToKZ data-wc=23>"Oh no - Alexa and I do sing together but I would never think anyone would care to hear me sing with Billy!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0fc045a62f25-cb-final-1-z.jpg><h3>You’ve said in the past that a "good friendship is the basis for everything" do you still think that, and are you looking for romance?</h3><p id=eS3cDfxbWRcG data-wc=30>"I am not looking for romance - there is an expression when you don't look, it happens so I haven't been looking for a while and maybe it will happen.</p><p id=eLfCLoOALwqr data-wc=24>"It's not very often my friends set me up, but <strong>recently a friend has sort of made an introduction </strong>so we'll see what happens..."</p><h3>You have a very close relationship with your children, what is the key to that success?</h3><p id=exQHmh8Xg3jq data-wc=49>"I think that the key is good real estate—have a house on the ocean and you will see your kids! But in all seriousness, it is just spending time together and there is no replacement for that. It's being there for them no matter what happens in their life."</p><h3>Sailor is a model too - do you give her modeling advice?</h3><p id=ez-0eAZX7O6Q data-wc=42>"Of course I would give her advice if she asked for it. <a class=hm-link href=#>Sailor enjoys modeling</a> and the opportunities she’s been given; she is working on other projects and taking a business course at Harvard online so she will know how to develop her many ideas.</p><p id=eOOgEkO1czKw data-wc=25>"I have no doubt she will be successful and there’s no rush. I say to my kids all the time, 'I still try new things.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5f484dec7ee8-cb-final-5-z.jpg><h3>You often share pictures of your children in your clothes and vice versa - how did that start?</h3><p id=eyvLytqGZS8J data-wc=10>"That's where I figure out where my clothes have gone!</p><p id=eO7m8xom2XPp data-wc=45>"People that follow us know we're big into convenience clothes, lots of overalls, because we spend a lot of time in the country and so lots of my male followers sometimes comment when I share something different, 'thank god you are not in the overalls!'</p><p id=eeJI7sc-pNCT data-wc=33>"But <strong>I have been threatening to do my own line of jumpsuits </strong>because the perfect one doesn't exist. I like to get dressed in less than 60 seconds and be out the door."</p><h3>You recently appeared as a contestant on The Masked Singer, how did that come about?</h3><p id=eKIWb8lcilu9 data-wc=38>"I almost did ,&nbsp;I did three weeks of rehearsals and then I broke my arm very badly so Sailor came in and saved the day and learned my dances in no time at all.</p><p id=eoCf-flUyfC5 data-wc=70>"The same producers then<strong><a class=hm-link href=#> asked me to do The Masked Singer.</a></strong> But I don't know if I can do again because when I broke my arm I also did something to my shoulder which has not recovered. I have done a round of MRIs and they told me I need a complete shoulder replacement and I don't have time for that, so now I am looking at stem cell treatments, and we'll see how that goes.</p><p id=ebYuKgDvnhrb data-wc=23>"When I lift my arm it has a serious snag and it can be really painful, some days it is worse than others.</p><p id=enj-zBIbKb8Z data-wc=49>"I couldn't keepa secret from my family though, so they kept it along with me. They would catch me singing in front of my computer, really singing away the same song and be like 'Mom are you okay?' so I had to let them know."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1646ef75a01c-maskedsinger-christiebrinkley-z.jpg><h3>Did you choose your costume?</h3><p id=eKloRYpnvKWh data-wc=40>"I got the choice of two costumes, and one was bodycon and fierce and I thought, 'I could wear something like that modeling,' but the other was cuddly and fuzzy and easy so I knew I would be so comfortable.</p><p id=eRhRmGTI6Anf data-wc=53>"The <strong>costume department was so disappointed that I went with the fuzzy animal one</strong>, which also had flat shoes in the sketch – but little did I know the tail was the biggest tail they ever created in the history of the show. It was like strapping a telephone pole to my body.</p><p id=eRkUYYcXEPQh data-wc=41>"The straps started at my hips and went to my collarbone to hold it on to me and keep me from falling over sideways, and I am in good shape, but I could hardly breathe and you need air to sing!</p><p id=ezlMw_njoD6Y data-wc=37>"And they gave me high heels that were attached to my pants, so I had to leave my aching feet on. It was not my best performance in the world but people were so kind and sweet."</p><p id=eDil5h-Qt5FE data-wc=13></p><p id=eVpUKS0kcYn0 data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#> Sign up to our HELLO! newsletters</a> to get other stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yRa2duaGJmgHmEkG5mnKCinsC1tcRmmauhnqC5psWMrJ%2BaqpWoerOt0Z5knZ2klratv4ynnLBloqS6orrCnmScoJmhsbOxzWafqKWVYrGqs8itmKVlk6TDpr6O</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
