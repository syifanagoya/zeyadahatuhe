Host Lipton, 87, started by discussing the actors' childhoods and biggest roles before HIMYM.</p><p>Harris, 40, talked about his star-making role as the titular kid doctor in the late '80s/early '90s TV show Doogie Howser, M.D., and how hard it was to attend high school with his child star part. Hannigan, 39, discussed her role on the beloved series Buffy the Vampire Slayer; she even recited her infamously raunchy "this one time at band camp" line from the 1999 comedy American Pie.</p><p>Segel, 34, meanwhile, recalled his full-frontal nude scene (opposite <a href=#><strong>Kristen Bell</strong></a>) in 2008 comedy film Forgetting Sarah Marshall. The actor revealed he didn't tell his mother about the scene until she saw it in theaters.</p><p>Things heated up during the taping when the cast did a question-and-answer session as their own characters. While Hannigan (Lily) was discussing her relationship with Smulders (Robin), Lipton asked if the girlfriends were attracted to each other. "Alyson then made out with Cobie and the crowd went wild!" the insider tells Us.</p><p>Another highlight from the upcoming interview? Harris' family — fiance <strong>David Burtka</strong> and 3-year-old twins Gideon and Harper — called in and video chatted with Harris and the audience.</p><p>According to the witness, Harris' son said, "Hi daddy, we love you! Show us all of them!!" The audience then waved at the actors' family and little Gideon laughed and begged for "more daddy."</p><p>Throughout the taping, the cast's love for one another was very evident. "It's hard to imagine a cast that seemed closer and more comfortable with each other," the insider marvels. "The way they would all lean in to support each other, but allow each other time to speak."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After filming their Inside the Actors Studio episode, which doesn't yet have an official air date, the costars and friends dined at ABC Cocina together after the taping. "Delicious props to chef Ian Coogan and the staff at @ABCCocina," Harris <a href=#>tweeted</a> very early on Monday, Feb. 17. "The HIMYM cast just finished dinner and it was fantastic! #wellplayed."</p><p>Later that night, the quintet gathered together once again to present the Top Ten List on Late Show with David Letterman where they shared the "Top Ten Surprises in The Final Episode of How I Met Your Mother." Number nine on the countdown? "The real father: Frank Sinatra."&nbsp;</p><p>The ninth and final season of the show is set to air on March 31.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ%2Bor12eeq6x02awqK2iYrqwwMeeqWabkajBbsDAqZysZZmjwKqwxGaroZ1dlrC1u9GsZKyspZm2sHnEsZqlraOew6Z5w56rmqGcqHpzfJBtaHJqXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
