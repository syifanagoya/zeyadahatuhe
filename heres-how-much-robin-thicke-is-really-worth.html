"I was so arrogant that I thought I could handle it all," he revealed. "That year was a whirlwind of fame, and overindulgence all coming to a head," he continued. "Fame ... got to me. I was in a bad place. I'm happy to have closed that chapter."&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, his hit "Blurred Lines" did come with a large paycheck. Aside from having to settle with Marvin Gaye, the single track brought in over $16.6 million in profits for Thicke and his producing partners, per&nbsp;<a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>.&nbsp;Thicke also sued later father Alan Thicke's third wife Tanya Callau over his inheritance, winding up with 20% (about $3 million)&nbsp;of his dad's $15.7 million estate, as per <a href=#>The Blast</a>.&nbsp;Despite the legal battles and his divorce, Thicke is estimated to be worth $10 million today by&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. And according to <a href=#>The Things</a>, Thicke reportedly makes $100,000 per episode for judging on The Masked Singer. Plus, with his new album slated for release, Thicke's fortunes will only go up from here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG1ha4R2e8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZaKkr6q6jK2fopubmnqqv4yrnJqknK56uLvRrZ9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DashJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
